# Outline for Common Intranet or Shared Knowledgebase

## Basic Structure

An intranet should be simple, and a single source of truth to to one function: Answer people's questions. There should be a single site for the company, a single copy of the authoritative document, and restricted ability to change that document based on the needs of the organization at their particular stage of development.

#### Searching for Content 

Making content easy to search is a major factor in the success of an Intranet, as is the structure/context of the content provided. Providing a structure with the following permissions and search options often works well:

- Intranet - Viewable by all, editable by a handful
  - Navigation
  - Search (Intranet)
  - Search (other resources)
  - Bookmarking
- Shared Drive - Viewable by all, editable by a handful, typically only reference links to the content library
  - Navigation
  - Search
- Content Library - View permissions are restricted to the team(s) that own the content, editable by the team(s) that own the content **the real "source of truth" for your organization's content**

## Intranet Page Outline

The Intranet pages should only be updated by people who own the Intranet. Pages should provide context and searchability, but should reference the answer which is located in the Library.

### HOME / LANDING PAGE

This is the first page people see. A good goal for your site is: from the landing page, can a person get to the answer/information they want within three submitted actions (click, enter key, complete text entry w/ autoresponse).

### HOW-TO

This is a simple, often one-page resource with a (potentially long) list of the most commonly asked questions from employees. The questions listed should use the language your employees use, and the answers should be simple and ultra-clear: e.g. direct to a resource, inform about an action to take, direct the mto an action or indicate this is not somethign we do. This should be one of the most commonly used resources in your intranet.

### ANSWERS / RESOURCES

This area of the intranet usually contains sub-pages. Try to resist the temptation here to make the sub-pages named by department e.g. "IT, HR, Legal". Generally, people don't search for things like that! Individuals tend to search for things by the "type of the thing":

* I am a manager and need to know how to do manager things
* I am an employee and need benefits informations
* I use business technology and need help
* I work with customers and need to know how we sell, communicate to customers
* I support the brand and need to know about our branding rules
* I support the building of our product and want to know about our product philosophy
* Company templates

### OTHER

This is a special section that should be used for the truly unique aspect of your business: one philosophy or activity that makes your culture/company unique!

### Shared Drive Representation of your Site

For services like Google Sites and Googel Drive or Sharepoint, providing a searchable (read only) shared drive structure that matches the outline of your Intranet can be an easy way to provide people another way to access content through shared drive search/navigation.

The Library should have two main sections:

* The Site (mirrors the outline of your site and is only referencing content 

## The Library / Referenced Document Storage and Content Management

If the Intranet pages are meant to be the interface where people navigate and search by "type of the thing", the library is all of the content referenced in your Intranet by the "category of the things". This is where organizing by division, department and team is helpful since the library is where all the content referenced in your Intranet is stored and managed by the owners of that system, process or "thing".

* Library
* Follow the structure of the site
* Allow for search within the site, to limit results to authoritative docs only
